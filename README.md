Simple react-redux application to add/remove books with title and description.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Other than [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) boiler plate, I also used [Bootstrap V3.3](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)

The purpose of this project was to gain some practice and understand how the logic works by using basic features of Redux framework.
